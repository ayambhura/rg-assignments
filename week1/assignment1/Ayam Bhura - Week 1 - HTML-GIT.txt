Git, GitHub, and IntelliJ Q&A
1.	What is the use of the git add command?
      It stages changes made to files so they can be committed. Without using git add, changes won’t be saved in the next commit.
2.	Write the command to create a branch “feature-group”.
      Using the command: “git branch feature-group”. This creates a new branch named 'feature-group'.
3.	What is a pull request? Write the steps involved in creating a pull request.
    A pull request lets you request merging changes from one branch to another. To create one: push your branch, click 'Compare & pull request', then submit.
4.	 How do you add collaborators?
    Go to your GitHub repo Settings > Collaborators, then invite by email. Collaborators must accept the invite.
5.	What is the command used to commit our changes in github repo?
    Use the command: git commit -m “message". This saves staged changes with a message.
6.	Create a github account and repository to save all your assignment tasks. Example repository name: rg-assignments
    Click 'New repository' to create one. Name it 'rg-assignments'.
7.	 Create a branch called feature-java (you can use it later to push all your java related tasks to this branch)
    Use the command: git checkout -b feature-java. It creates and switches to the 'feature-java' branch.
8.	Install IntelliJ IDE. Create a simple java project displaying “Hello World!!” and share the screenshot.
    Create a new Java project. Create a class with a main method and print 'Hello World!!'.
9.	 In IntelliJ IDE, explore the shortcut keys for the following
    a. Run the project: Shift + F10
    b. Select a line: Home, then Shift + End
    c. Comment/Uncomment: Ctrl + /
    d. Delete a line: Ctrl + Y
